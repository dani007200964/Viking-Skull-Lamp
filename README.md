# Viking Skull Lamp ![Build Status](https://github.com/dani007200964/Viking-Skull-Lamp/actions/workflows/compile_test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

## Introduction

I ​made this project for my brother. He loves Halloween and asked me to create a Viking-style lamp that has a glowing skull.
This is what comes out of this idea. I roughly had five months to test the device before publishing it. I can happily say
that in this period nothing went wrong with it. It just worked like a charm. Also, I have worked a lot on the documentation,
meanwhile. Here you can see what can this thing do.
