These tools are required to create this project. Without them it is almost impossible
to finish every section. Also if you are a maker these tools can be used later for
future projects.

![Essential Tools](equipment_basic.jpg)

* Screwdriver with a lot of bitheads
* Superglue
* Side cutter
* Multimeter
* Tweezers
* Soldering iron
* Fume extractor
* Exacto knife
* Tapping set
* Caliper
* Pliers
* Connector crimping pliers( [PA-09](https://www.engineertools-jp.com/pa092021) for example )
* 3D printer with 180mm * 180mm * 150mm volume at least

@note If you do some soldering work PLEASE USE A FUME EXTRACTOR. That smoke is very
dangerous, it can kill you. Please solder in a well ventilated area with some kind
of fume extractor. You can build one with some carbon filter and a PC fan.

In this section I show some tools, that I used in this project. These are not necessary
to finish the project, but they can accelerate the process and the result will be
more professional.

* Bench supply - If you want to power up prototype electronics it can be a lifesaver.
You can limit the current to a safe level, this way if something's wrong with the
circuit, it wont blow to your face at the smoke test.
* Hot air station - If you do some SMD rework it is a game changer. Also it can be
used for heat shrinking tubes.
* Label maker - One of my favorite gadgets. If you want to organize something it is
the right tool. I use it every time when I have more cable than one.
* Stripping tool - This thing is awesome, when you have to deal with cables. It is
not cheap, but your can strip cable ends like a God with it. Also your hand wont
hurt after a day.
* End sleeve crimper - If you have to deal with terminal blocks, this think is very useful.
You can press the end sleeves with regular pliers, but it's hard to fit in the terminal block
that way. There are cheap solutions, I highly recommend to get one.
* Solder sucker - It can be useful with THT components.
* Oscilloscope - There are a huge variety of scopes today. There are cheap ones like
the [DS212](https://www.miniware.com.cn/product/ds212-mini-oscilloscope-digital-oscilloscope/).
It is cheap and do the job for basic circuits. Sadly the interface is hard to use.
