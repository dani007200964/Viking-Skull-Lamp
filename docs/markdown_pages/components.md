This table shows all the required components to build this project. I tried to use generic
parts to make the sourcing easier. I included the distributors which I used. I calculated
the nominal quantity for everything, but I also included the quantity, that I recommend
to source. It is always a good thing if you have some spare parts, you can use them later.
It is very frustrating when something has less in stock than needed. Also sometimes you
stumble upon a bad module( encoder, display... ) that doesn't work. Personally, I had only
one incident with a cheap display module in the years, but you get the idea.

This is a special topic. Because the PCB has a relatively high amount of components, I think
it's better to handle that separately. Because the PCB designer software that I used can create
an interactive HTML-based component list, I included that in the
@ref how_to_get_the_right_components "How To Get PCB Components" section. It can be used for
PCB assembly as well.
