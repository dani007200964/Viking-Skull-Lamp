right category to report it.

This category is created for circuit-related problems.
For example, if you build the PCB and something does not work. Or if you find a problem
with the layout or in the schematics.

üìú [Documentation problem](https://github.com/dani007200964/Viking-Skull-Lamp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=documentation&template=documentation_problem.md&title=) -
This category is created for documentation-related
problems. For example, if you find a wrong part number, quantity, or parameter. Or if
some comment in the code is wrong. Or if a section is doesn't understandable.

üöÄ [Feature request](https://github.com/dani007200964/Viking-Skull-Lamp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=) -
If you have a new idea, you can share it with this template.

üõ†Ô∏è [Mechanical problem](https://github.com/dani007200964/Viking-Skull-Lamp/issues/new?assignees=&labels=mechanical&template=mechanical_problem.md&title=) -
This category is created for mechanical-related problems.
For example, some parts are worn quickly. Or you can not reproduce it, because it's
too complex. Also if you have a different printer than mine and it can't make a part
as precise as needed, please report it, maybe it can be modified to make it good for
everyone.

how to solve it please describe your solution as well.

@section discussion_section Discussion Section

![Discussions](discussion.png)

This section can be useful for people, who started to use GitHub recently. This is a very
intuitive and simple way to share your ideas and ask questions. Also if you made this thing
you can share it with others. Also if you modified or remixed it, please share it with the
community( I hope someone will make a stormtrooper helmet version \emoji :eyes: ).

@section pull_request Pull Request

If you solved a problem, or you made some change in the project and you want to share
it, you can create a [pull request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lGpZkjnkt4).
This way you can contribute to this project.

@note If you never made a pull request before, you can find a lot of tutorials on
the web. It is not that hard, and actually, there are a ton of graphical tools to use
git, so you don't have to use the command line.
