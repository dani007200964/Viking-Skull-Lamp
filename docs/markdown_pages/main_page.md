@mainpage Viking Skull Lamp

__Introduction__

I have made this project for my brother. He asked me to create a Viking style lamp, that have a glowing skull. This is what come out from this idea.
The result came out pretty good I think, so I decided to share this project with the world. The device was finished in June of 2022 and I decided to
announce the design for the 2022 Halloween Contest on Printables.com. So I roughly had five month to test the device before publishing it. I can
happily say that in this period nothing went wrong with it, it just worked like a charm. Also I have worked a lot on the documentation in this time.
Here you can see what can this ting actually do. Also there are some nice photos about the lighting in the @ref gallery "gallery".

I want to clarify at the beginning that this is not a beginner level project. It's more like a hardcore one.
If you love to create stuff and you are brave enough to start this journey, this documentation will guide you
through the whole assembly procedure. Before you start buying the components, please check the
@ref required_tools "required tools" page. It contains everything you need to create this device. If you doesn't
have a tool it will be clear at the beginning.

At the beginning I would say that I'm a human and I have made this whole thing on my own. I tried to not make mistakes in the
device or it's documentation, but mistakes happen. If you find a problem, our something does not understandable, please visit
the @ref issue_guide "issue guide" section. There is an example how to submit an issue, and I will try my best to fix them.

This journey consists of four stages. You have to start from the first and progress upwards.

1. \ref print_guide "3D Printing Parts:" Firstly, you have to print all the necessary parts. There are some tricky ones
so read the __print guide__ section carefully.

2. \ref pcb_assembly "PCB Assembly:" I have designed a custom PCB for this project. It expands the functionality of
the Arduino UNO platform. It controls all the peripherals in the system.

3. \ref software_guide "Software Guide:" Of course this project have a custom firmware. It is written in C++ and I
have used PlatformIO as a development tool.

4. \ref assembly_instructions "Mechanical Assembly:" Finally it's time to assemble the whole thing.
